    Welcome to the Ecosystem simulation
    The aim of this project is to simulate a very simple ecosystem, composed by particles (circles) and the source of food (squares).
    The simulation is guided by cycles, in each cycle the particles must feed and reproduce in other to keep themselves alive and keep the "specie" alive.
    If a particle ate then it shall survive the next cycle. In each reproduction there's a small percentage of the offspring getting a mutation that may affect it's speed.
    Please procede to select the number of particles that the simulation should start.
